Hello there
I have made this project over a course of 40-50 days using my knowledge in C++. I had to learn about basics of OpenCV and windows APIs to compile everything. 
I used Microsoft Visual Studio as the IDE. My code requires a webcam to read the video feed which is processed frame by frame for the number of fingers open. 
Here is the breakup of the gestures.
1.) One finger open: Volume increases
2.) Two fingers open: Volume decreases
3.) Three fingers open: Screenshot taken and saved to the destination folder
4.) Five fingers open for 1 sec then closed fist: System Shuts Down after 10 seconds.
5.) Five fingers open for 1 sec then one finger open: System Restarts after 10 seconds.
6.) Five fingers open for 1 sec then two fingers open: System sleeps after 10 seconds.

I have also included a settings option in which you can,
1.) Change the destination folder of screenshots.
2.) Change the maximum limit of screenshots saved at a time in the folder.
3.) Calibrate the software according to your lighting.

Here's a video showing the working of the project: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/garvit-sadhwani-8a76b016b_c-opencv-github-activity-6824322663842951168-e9ka
